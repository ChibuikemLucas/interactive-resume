# Modern JavaScript Deep Dive

Hello there, it's your favourite developer here. This is my first project in my **javascript deep dive** which is a **30 day project-oriented learning series** i've curated to assist
developers like me in escaping tutorial hell with online courses and instead build and learn from projects which could be added to their resumes.

Asides the readme file more details on this project and subsequent ones will be provided on the sites below:

- [X](https://x.com/ChibuikemLucas): A list of the tasks completed for the day.
- [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/chibuikem-lucas-073355261/): A more detailed explanation of the tasks completed, with a key lesson for each day.
- Hashnode: A full recap of the entire day, problems, how they were solved and key takeaways.

>  *Now let's get started with the first project an interactive resume.*
